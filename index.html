      <h2>🙌🏼My last semester as an undergraduate📚</h2>

      <p>Welcome to my first web page! As the week is coming to an end, I'm excited
      to reflect on the fact that my college experience is also coming to an end.
      I graduate in May, and although I still don't know if there will be a graduation
     ceremony... I cannot wait to finally hold my Bachelor's degree diploma and hang it
     on my wall somewhere in my home. But before my time at UM is over, I am enjoying
     and learning as much as I can about broadcast journalism through the shows I
     am currently involved with which are the following:</p>


       <h3>🌴Unimiami🌴</h3>
       <p>UMTV's spanish show where I'll be hosting the 3-0-5 Segment where I'll have
       the chance to visit and create stories based on cultural and symbolic places
       in Miami. I've been involved with this show since my first semester at UM
       and I've learned so much about the ins and outs of producing a TV Show. It
       definetily has a warm spot in my heart more than any other activities I've been
       involved in at UM</p>

      <h3>🏈Sportsdesk🏈</h3>
      <p>Such a fun show! It covers stories from UM student athletes to the NBA.
      I don't know much about sports, but I love the energy this show brings.
      This semester I'm helping with the cameras as well as creating a news package
      where I'll definitely want to interview a student athelete and tell their story.</p>


      <h2>🔥What's Next?🏀</h2>

        <p>After a few job applications, I received an e-mail about an interview for a
    position at the HEAT. And... I GOT THE JOB!!!!! I am actually having my first
    training meeting via Zoom today and my first day is next week for the next
    homegame where the HEAT will be playing against the Toronto Rapters.</p>

        <p>I'll be part of a team that works with social media, the
      fan experience, and events. Even though we are still living with COVID-19, things
      are going to be a bit different. But I'm just so happy. My goal is to eventually
      transfer to the broadcast media department at the HEAT and be involved with
      the live production of games.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 put alot of things on hold but now is a new year
      and I am just glad things are working out. I am grateful to graduate with a
     Bachelor's in Electronic Media, and begin my job with the HEAT this year.
     Thank you for reading.</p>


        <p>Three Words I live by:</p>

            <li>Patience</li>
            <li>Gratitude</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
          </ol>

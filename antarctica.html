            <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>A speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed
          until the early 1820s when British and America commercial operators
          and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the
          Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic
          Circle. It wasn't until the early 1840s that it was established that
          Antarctica was indeed a continent and not merely a group of islands
          or an area of an ocean. Although there was little human activity in
          the early 20th century, it was following World War II that the continent
          experienced an un-surge in scientific research.</p>

          <p>A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal
          stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in
          Antarctica. A total of seven countries have made territorial claims,
          but most countries do not recognize these claims. </p>

          <p>In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on
          the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies
          nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959,
          it entered into force in 1961. Also, relevant to Antarctic governance
          are: the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty, and the
          Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>

          <h3>Area</h3>

          <p>The location of Antarctica is mostly south of the Antarctic Circle.
             It is slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Total: 14.2 million sq km</li>
            <li>Land: 14.2 million sq km (285,000 sq km ice-free, 13.915 million
            sq km ice-covered) (est.)</li>
            <li>Coastline: 17,968 km</li>
            <li>Note: Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, following Asia,
               Africa, North America, and South America, but larger than Australia
               and the subcontinent of Europe.</li>

        <p>The coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth with severe
        low temperatures that vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from
        the ocean. East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its
        higher elevation. Antarctic peninsula has the most moderate climate.</p>

        <p>Higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average
        slightl below freezing. Summers are characterized by continuous daylight,
        while winters bring continuous darkness. Persistent high pressure over
        the interior brings dry, subsiding air that results in very little
        cloud cover.</p>

        <p>Antarctic animals are exposed to some of the coldest environments on
          earth and these animals have physical adaptions and patterns of behaviour
          that help them survive the extreme conditions. Penguins and elephant seals
          have thick layers of fat and blubber that help keep them warm. They also
          adapt by forming large huddles that allow them to share body warmth and
          help shelter them from winds. With penguins, The huddle constantly moves
          so that all the penguins have a turn in the middle (huddling can reduce
          heat loss by up to 50%.</p>

        <p>There are no indigenous inhabitants, but there are both permanent and
        summer-only staffed research stations.</p>

        <p>53 countries have signed the 1959 Antarctic Treaty; 30 of those
        operate through their National Antarctic Program a number of seasonal-
        only (summer) and year-round research stations on the continent and
        its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region covered
        by the Antarctic Treaty). The population engaging, supporting science,

          <p>Scientific undertakings rather than commercial pursuits are the

          <h3>Government</h3>

          <p>Name "Antarctica" is derived from two Greek words meaning "opposite
          to the Arctic" or "opposite to the north". Antarctica is administered
          through annual meetings-known as Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings-
          which include consultative member nations, non-consultative member nations,
          observer organizations, and expert organizations.</p>

          <p>Decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member nations
           (with respect to their own nationals and operations) in accordance with
           their own national laws. More generally, the Antarctic Treaty area
           (areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude), is subject to relevant
           legal instruments and procedures adopted by the states party to the
           Antarctic Treaty.</p>

        <p>Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica with penalties up to 10,000
          in fines and one year in prison. Some of the civil and criminal offences
          are:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Murder</li>
             <li>the taking of native mammals or birds</li>
             <li>entry into specially protected areas</li>
             <li>the discharge or disposal of pollutants</li>
             <li>the introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals</li>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2>

            <p>Hello and welcome to my page! Thank you for stopping by :)
            I am a grateful student at the University of Miami completing a Bachelor's
            degree in Electronic Media Production with minors in Broadcast Journalims and Theater Arts.
            I love getting to know people, their experiences, and their goals. I want to get to know the fellow members of communities
             near me and I aim to explore the world around me. Weather it'd be news reporting, electronic media production,
             multimedia journalism, customer service. I am always hungry for a new experience.
            </p>

            <p>I am currently a senior student and part of the Miami Heat Organization a
            a Mobile Support Specialist.My next goal is to grow as much as I can with the HEAT organization and eventually
            make my way into the Broadcast Team Department. I want to produce content, conduct player interviews,
            assist with marketing ads, and anything related to broadcasting so I can continue to grow as a producer
            and assist with new projects.</p>

          <h3>TMH: University of Miami Student Newspaper</h3>
          <p>Aside from on camera experience, I've contributed to the student newspaper
          from UM. I've had the chance to interview students and tell their stories and cover off
          campus news such as guest speakers at UM or the recent chain of events that
          took place in Miami Beach during Spring break. I love finding new opportunities to learn from other people
          that can help me grow mentally, academically, and creatively.</p>
